## Introductions to dplyr and ggplot2

This repository contains the material for quick introductions to the R packages dplyr and ggplot2. The material was presented at an R workshop at the DFO Pacific Biological Station.

See the files `dplyr-intro.Rmd` and `ggplot-intro.Rmd` for R Markdown versions of the notes and completed exercises. 

The files `dplyr-intro.html` and `ggplot-intro.html` contain the "knitted" version of the notes and completed exercises. These HTML files have all the R output and figures rendered.

During the workshop we will be working through the files in the `exercises` folder. The files in this folder have some of the lines of code removed so that we can write the code as we go.
